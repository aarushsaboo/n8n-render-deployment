4. Sends a notification email via Gmail

## Customizing Your Workflow

You can modify the workflow within the n8n interface after importing. Remember to update the Google Sheet ID and email addresses to match your own.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your deployment:

- Ensure all environment variables are set correctly
- Verify that your OAuth credentials have the necessary permissions

## Maintaining Your Instance

- Render will automatically update to the latest n8n version if you're using the latest tag
- Back up your workflows regularly by exporting them from the n8n interface
- Monitor your Render dashboard for any service interruptions
